      <li>
        First, boil the water for the pasta while you prepare the carbonara
        sauce. Remember: 1 liter (4 cups) of water for every 100 g (3,50 oz) of
        pasta and 15 g (1 tablespoon) of coarse salt per liter (4 cups) of
        water. Cut the guanciale into small pieces (cubes, slices… as you
        prefer) then cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2 to 3
        minutes. Stir occasionally so that it cooks evenly. The more the
        guanciale cooks, the more its fat will melt and its meat will become
        crispy. The level of cooking is up to you, depending on your taste. Some
        people like their guanciale well cooked and others prefer it soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now prepare the pecorino cream. So, in a bowl put the eggs and pecorino
        Romano cheese. Use the whole egg, not only the egg yolk. Pecorino
        Romano, the only cheese that is recommended for making carbonara, is a
        very salty and flavorful Italian cheese so there is no need to add salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add some freshly ground black pepper. Then, mix quickly with a fork – or
        a hand whisk – until you have a creamy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        This egg and pecorino cheese sauce should be quite thick. Set it aside
        for the moment. The water should now be boiling so add the salt and cook
        the spaghetti. If you chose a fairly large pot, the spaghetti should fit
        comfortably without breaking them. Whole, unbroken spaghetti is best, so
        you can more easily roll them around the tines of your fork without the
        help of a spoon. #eatlikeanitalian The best way to cook spaghetti
        without breaking it’s to hold them in a bunch vertically and dip in the
        salted water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now let go and they will fall in all directions. As they soften, use a
        fork to let them sink in, then stir. Cook the spaghetti al dente,
        following the cooking time found on the pasta package.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spoon for spaghetti, drain the pasta when ready. Then place them
        in the skillet, over high heat, to season well with the guanciale.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the spaghetti and guanciale sizzle in the pan, TURN OFF THE HEAT,
        otherwise the eggs will overcook and you’ll end up with scrambled eggs
        and pasta! Now quickly add the eggs and pecorino cream to the hot pasta
        and stir. The pan is not too hot, this way the eggs will cook without
        lumps. Pay attention to the consistency, which should be creamy, but not
        runny. If you notice that your carbonara is too runny, add some grated
        pecorino cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Authentic spaghetti carbonara is ready. So, with the help of a ladle and
        a fork, create a pasta nest and place it on a plate. Add the guanciale
        (what’s left in the pan), freshly ground black pepper and grated
        pecorino romano to taste. Serve and enjoy!
