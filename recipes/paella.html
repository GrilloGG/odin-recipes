      Classic paella Valenciana recipe is the traditional chicken paella that
      many call the original. It combines chicken and either pork ribs or rabbit
      (your choice!) with green beans, butter beans, garlic, paprika, and
      saffron.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Put your paella pan on medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Then
        sprinkle all of the salt in a circle towards the edge of the pan. This
        will keep the oil from splattering too much. Now add all of the meat
        (the chicken and either rabbit or pork ribs). Brown the meat on all
        sides over the next 20 minutes — turn it every 3-5 minutes, allowing it
        to brown and caramelize a bit. All of the bits that stick to the pan
        here will come off when you add the tomato and water in the future — and
        they will really bring a deep flavor to the cooking liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the meat is well browned (about 20 minutes of cooking) push it to
        the sides of the pan. The olive oil should pool in the center. Add the
        green beans, cut into one inch pieces. Sauté the beans for about three
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now push the beans aside and add the garlic. Sauté for about 30 seconds
        (until fragrant) and add the butter beans. If you’re using jarred butter
        beans be careful not to break them. I gently move them to coat in the
        oil and garlic and then leave them about 30 seconds per side to get a
        bit browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the paprika and gently sauté for about one minute. Finally,
        add the crushed tomatoes and start to mix everything together. The
        tomato should start to deglaze the pan (loosen all of the stuck bits
        below). This is good, so feel free to help with a good scrape (I’d
        recommend a wooden spoon).
      </li>
      <li>
        As you start to mix in the tomato, you can also add the saffron (which
        you should soak in warm water for at least 10 minutes prior to adding).
        Next, you add the water. The tricky thing here is that you need to add
        the water for the stock and the rice cooking all at once. We know the
        rice is a 3:1 ratio, so what I learned it to first add this amount of
        water (see recipe card below for exact amounts) and then use a toothpick
        to remember how much the stock needs to reduce by to add the rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Insert a toothpick (or wooden spoon handle) into the center of the
        paella pan. You’ll see the line of where the water went up to when there
        was the perfect amount of liquid to add the rice. Keep this toothpick
        for later, when you’ll need to make sure you haven’t reduced the stock
        too much or too little, and you’re ready to add the rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you add the rest of the water. Simmer on medium for about 10
        minutes, and then lower the heat to a slow simmer for another 10
        minutes. In these 20 minutes the liquid will reduce and you’ll be left
        with a flavorful meat stock that is key to this paella recipe. After 20
        minutes the water should be the perfect amount to cook the rice — but of
        course we have to check to make sure! This is where you use the
        toothpick to see if you need to reduce a little more liquid, or if you
        need to add a bit more. Adjust accordingly, then add the rice.
