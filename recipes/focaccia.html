    <p>
      Focaccia is an olive oil-rich Italian bread we can't decide is better
      described metaphorically as a sponge or a springy mattress. It's crispy
      and golden on the top and bottom crusts, and inside, it has an airy crumb.

    <ol>
      <li>Whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast first</li>
      <li>Add the water</li>
      <li>Use a spatula to stir the two together</li>
      <li>
        Slick the surface of the dough with olive oil; then cover the bowl. You
        all have one of these, right? Stick the bowl in the fridge immediately;
        leave it there to rise for 12 to 18 hours (or longer—I have left it
        there for as long as three days)
      </li>
      <li>Remove from fridge, and remove the cover</li>
      <li>Deflate the dough and transfer to a prepared pan.</li>
      <li>
        After two to four hours it is time to dimple it! You can use simply
        olive oil and salt
      </li>
      <li>
        if you are using rosemary, sprinkle it over the dough. Then pour two
        tablespoons of olive oil over the dough, and using your fingers, press
        straight down to create deep dimples. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to oven immediately and bake at 425ºF for 25 minutes or until
        golden all around. Remove focaccia from pans and place on cooling racks.
      </li>
